In this work, we proposed the active gradual self-training (AGST) algorithm with active pseudolabeling and gradual semi-supervised domain adaptation to adapt deep neural networks to the changing environments, especially for online web applications, where the data distribution changes gradually due to the evolving environments.

We also created a new dataset -- Evolving-Image-Search (EVIS), which shows the evolution of web images in the time range of 12 years. Designed a crawler based on search engine to automatically collect this dataset.
